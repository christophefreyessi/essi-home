Title:European technological independence
The period of high uncertainties regarding import & export taxes is raising even more questions regarding European technological independence, including in the semiconductor value chain. 
In this specific sector, Europe has a lot of assets: world class industry leaders and labs, a wide range of innovative fabless companies, best in class universities…..
The European R&D effort in the semiconductor could definitively generate more value faster if better aligned to and leveraged by European electronic system makers
The aims of the EU System-driven Semiconductor Initiative (ESSI) are to identify and promote practical and impactful actions to increase and accelerate the generation of economic value coming from the European semiconductor products. It is paving the way for higher technological independence in Europe.
