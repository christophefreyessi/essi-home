    <h2>About Us</h2>
	<br><br>
	
	<p style="line-height: 1.8;">
	The European System-Driven Semiconductor Initiative (ESSI) is a European think-tank. <br>
	ESSI was established in 2024 to address a critical gap in Europe's semiconductor strategy: the disconnect between semiconductor development and the needs of system manufacturers.<br>
	</p>
	<br>
	<p style="line-height: 1.8;">
	This initiative emerged as a <strong>complementary initiative to the European Chips Act</strong>, to ensure that investments from the Chips Act reflect the needs of system manufacturers, not just chipmakers.<br>
	We are Identifying and promoting practical actions to <strong>align chip design</strong> and R&D more closely <strong>with system-level requirements</strong>, ensuring that investments in chip technologies translate effectively into competitive European products.<br>
	<br>
	The ESSI vision is to enable the fastest deployment of differentiated market-leading systems, leveraging the best European semiconductor products.
